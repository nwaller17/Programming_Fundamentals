Three Point Challenge Game
Enter your shooting scores, and see how they stack up to the winner of the
2 previous NBA 3 point contests, Damian Lillard! 
Enter "2023" or "2024" when prompted for a contest year to compare your score to 
the finalists of that year, or if you don't care for the NBA, enter a random number
to compare your scores to your favorite Looney Tunes characters. Entering "0" for 
the contest year will end the game, returning a list of your previous scores, and your
shooting percentage.
Each normal ball make is worth 1 point, money balls are worth 2, and starry balls 
are worth 3, per NBA rules.

Have fun playing!

Problem Statement- create a program that asks users for their total makes of each 
type of ball and a comparison year, and then calculates their shooting percentage and three point contest 
score. The program will output the users percentage, score, contestant above and below them
(where applicable) and a result message.

Nouns- total makes, comparison year, ball type, percentage, score, contestant, result

Verbs- asks, calculates, output

Inputs- makes for ball type, comparison year

Processing-
prompt user for comparison year
prompt user for makes of each type
calculate user score using equation with point values
calculate user percentage (total makes/27)
calculate comparable contestants
calculate result
output the score, percentage, contestants and results

Outputs- score, percentage, contestants, result message

Solution Algorithm-
ThreePointChallenge
  LOOP while contestYear !==0
    prompt user for comparison year
	prompt user for normal makes
	prompt user for money makes
	prompt user for starry makes
	calculate user score
	calculate user percentage
	convert percentage to rounded percentage (2 decimals)
	calculate contestants above, below and results
  END LOOP
  output userScore, roundedPercentage, contestantAbove, contestantBelow, result message
END
